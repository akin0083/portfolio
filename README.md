# Emmanuel Akingbemisilu - Web Portfolio

 Overview

This is my personal web portfolio created to showcase my skills in web design, development, and visual storytelling. It highlights my work in photography, digital design, and web development. The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework and includes custom styling and animations.

##  My Process

When planning this portfolio, I started by defining a structure that would be clean, modern, and responsive. I divided the site into four main sections: Hero, Skills, Work, and Contact. I used Figma for wireframing and then began developing the site using HTML and CSS. Bootstrap was added to streamline responsiveness and provide quick access to utility classes and layout grids.

I focused on using reusable CSS variables for colors and consistent spacing across sections. The hero section is flexbox-based, and I incorporated grid layouts in the work/gallery section for easy scalability.

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. **Responsive Design**
**Challenge:** Ensuring that the layout and images scale well on smaller screens without breaking.
**Solution:** I used Bootstrapâ€™s grid system and media queries to adjust layout flow and font sizes on different screen widths.

### 2. **Sticky Footer**
**Challenge:** Keeping the footer at the bottom of the page regardless of content height.
**Solution:** I implemented a CSS-based `sticky foote` solution using `mt-auto` (Bootstrap utility class) and some custom flexbox configuration in the layout.

### 3. **Hero Section Alignment**
**Challenge:** Getting the hero text and image to sit side-by-side while remaining aligned on all screen sizes.
**Solution:** I used `flexbox` combined with `wrap-reverse` on smaller screens to allow vertical stacking while maintaining a clean horizontal layout on desktops.
